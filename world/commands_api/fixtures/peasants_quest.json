"Ask about _____":
Baby:
(to Baby Lady) - "This little guy's all I got left. If only someone would steal back all our riches from that filthy Jhonka."
Fire:
(to knight) - "Well, whenever I see peasants, they tend to be on fire. So get yourself on fire. I hear horse grease gives a nice, controlled burn."
(to baby lady) - "You need fire? A couple of trees over by the waterfall used to be on fire. But now there's like a signal lantern over there or something." / "So should I ask that signal lantern?" you ask. / "I dunno man! Whattaya want from me?"
(to Mendelev and Dongolev) - "Trogdor just burned down some idiot peasant's cottage. You should ask him," says Mendelev. / "Yeah, this jerk goes on vacation to some prancey lake and..." / They see you staring daggers at them and turn bright red. / "Oh. Nevermind," says Dongolev. "Um, yeah. What's a fire?" adds Mendelwhatever.
(to Jhonka) - "Burninator make fire! Barbecue all peasants!"
(to innkeeper) - "I've always preferred being on fire at night. Looks prettier and keeps the butterflies away."
Jhonka:
(to knight) - "Since the Kerrek showed up, we don't see the Jhonka so much anymore. He lives in that little cave over in west Peasantry."
(to Baby Lady) - "That nasty thing killed my husband and took my riches!!" / "I thought Trogdor killed your husband," you interject. / "Oh right. Yeah. That's what I said. Trogband killed my husbdor."
(to Jhonka) - "The Kerrek is dead!" he cries and hops around some more. You wonder how someone this primitive could have made that much dough.
Kerrek:
(to knight) - "I call him Big Stinky. He's slow and stupid, but he'll pound you into milks meat without a second thought."
Naked Ned:
(to knight) - "That weirdo used to live over in west Peasantry but now I guess he just prances around the forest in his birthday suit."
(to baby lady) - "Don't talk about that pervert in front of the baby here."
(to Mendelev and Dongolev) - "That guy creeps us out. In fact, shut up about him."
(to Jhonka) - "Filthy naked peasant! Stay away from my cave-hole!" Who's he calling naked? HE'S the one wearing the string bikini.
(to innkeeper) - "He used to be such a nice, clothed young man. Wonder what he's done with all his old clothes?"
robe:
(to knight) - "Peasants wear those brown robes. You know, with the rope around the waist. Get yourself one of those."
(to baby lady) - "You can't have mine, pervert! I'm not a nudist peasant like that weirdo over in west Peasantry!"
(to Mendelev and Dongolev) - "We wouldn't know. We only wear archer clothes. You just can't arch real well in a robe, y'know?"
(to Jhonka) - see naked ned
(to innkeeper) - "I wear my robe hood-down so it's easier to trim my ear-hairs. If you need a robe, maybe try someone that's not using theirs."
smell:
(to knight) - "I never met a peasant that didn't stink. If you wanna smell bad, get the Kerrek involved. That thing reeks!"
(to baby lady) - "What smells is junior here's drawers! I gotta quit feeding him so much horse!" / "And don't start asking me for his diapers, sicko!"
(to Mendelev and Dongolev) - "That giant pig running around sure smells bad. Maybe talk to him."
(to Jhonka) - "Kerrek smell! Now Kerrek dead!" screeches the Jhonka. So you can infer from this that all smells are dead? You always sucked at the analytical questions.
(to innkeeper) - "Well, if you don't stink, maybe find something that does and wear it. Like a dead carcass or summat."
trogdor:
(to knight) - "If I had a gold coin for every whining peasant's cottage that freaking dragon burninated, I'd be rich as a jhonka."
(to baby lady) - "I hope you kill that stupid dragon. My 'Wives of Squished Peasants' support group would bake you a Poor Gary pie if you did."
(to Mendelev and Dongolev) - "Oh man, there was this one time when I came THIS close to having Trogdor ARROWED!" says Dongolev. / "Hey, shut up! That was me!" interrupts Mendelev,
"YOU almost arrowed that blue baby!" says Dongolev. / "Did not!" / "Did so!" / "Did not!" / (You see where this is going.)
(to Jhonka) - "All hail Burninator! Trogdor Number One! Beat Peasant Tech!" says the grimy Jhonka.
(to innkeeper) - "Are you talking about that young green boy that lives up the street? He's always tearing my roof off and eating my customers."
anything else:
(to knight) - "I don't know anything about that, short pants."
(to baby lady) - "I dunno what you're talking about."
(to Mendelev and Dongolev) - "Either we don't know anything about that, or you're real boring."
